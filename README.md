# HTML-course-final-project
This is the final course project that I created while following along with the video course for the Udemy HTML and CSS course by Jonas Schmedtmann (https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). I had to research myself a few parts which were outdated to make the website function properly. This project was the starting point for my other HTML and CSS project, from which I added and removed things to make the design radically different.<br> 
Here is where you can see the final version:<br>
